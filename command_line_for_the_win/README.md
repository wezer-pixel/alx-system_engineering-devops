# Command Line F

* I used SFTP to connect to the Ubuntu 14.04 - Python 3.4 sandbox
* I then used ssh to log in to the sandbox on a second terminal.
* I used the ssh terminal to clone the alx-system_engineerin-devops and create the command_line_for_the_win directory al in the root dir.
* I used the put command on the sftp terminal to upload the screenshots in the required directory.
