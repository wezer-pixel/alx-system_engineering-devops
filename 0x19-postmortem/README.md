# Postmortem in software Engineering
A postmortem is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents.
They involve analysis and discussion after an incident, that result in forming an artifact with detailed description of the event.
Steps taken to diagnose, assess, and resolve issues are recorded.
Timelines and ways of preventing such an event from occuring again are also taken into account.
